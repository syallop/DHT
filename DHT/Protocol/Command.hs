Model the commands a dht must be able to handle and issue.
'Commands' are singletons indexed by a unique (c::CMD) type.

Closed type functions determine for each cmd type:
- Target: Either targeted at individual Address's or the DHT as a whole
- In: Input to a command.
- Out: Expected output.
- Resp: The type required to respond to a recieved command such that the sender can recognise it and extract the Out
